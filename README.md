# Glossary

A glossary of terms used by Agile Sprints.

## KPI

KPIs are part of a broader family of agile KPIs. Agile metrics include lean metrics, which focus on the flow of value from an organization to its customers, and Kanban metrics, which focus on workflow and getting tasks done. While most agile metrics are applicable to scrum teams, scrum-specific metrics focus on predictable software delivery, making sure scrum teams deliver maximum value to customers with every iteration.

## OKR

OKR has a set of rules, although not as codified as Scrum. Those rules determine what an Objective can be, what Key Results are, and how they work together to measure the achievement of goals. Like Scrum, OKR has timeframes, however, these are a lot longer (quarterly and yearly) than two-week sprints. Creating OKRs involves first, company leadership deciding what they want to achieve, then teams creating their own OKRs and aligning them to the goals of the company.

## Agile methodology

Agile is a process by which a team can manage a project by breaking it up into several stages and involving constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement and iteration at every stage. The Agile methodology begins with clients describing how the end product will be used and what problem it will solve. This clarifies the customer's expectations to the project team. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating — which might just change the final deliverable to fit the customer's needs better. Continuous collaboration is key, both among team members and with project stakeholders, to make fully-informed decisions.

## SCRUM methodology

Scrum is an agile project management methodology or framework used primarily for software development projects with the goal of delivering new software capability every 2-4 weeks. It is one of the approaches that influenced the Agile Manifesto, which articulates a set of values and principles to guide decisions on how to develop higher-quality software faster.
Scrum is widely used by software development teams. In fact it's the most popular agile methodology. According to the 12th annual State of Agile report, 70% of software teams use Scrum or a Scrum hybrid. However, Scrum has spread to other business functions including IT and marketing where there are projects that must move forward in the presence of complexity and ambiguity. Leadership teams are also basing their agile management practices on Scrum, often combining it with lean and Kanban practices (subgroups of agile project management).

## Sprint

A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies, and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.  
“With Scrum, a product is built in a series of iterations called sprints that break down big, complex projects into bite-sized pieces," said Megan Cook, Group Product Manager for Jira Software at Atlassian.  

## Velocity

Velocity is the master KPI you should look at.
It is a measure of the amount of work your team can tackle during a single sprint and is the key metric in Scrum.
How fast are we going is the question. It is a compound indicator of 5 different variables that are
(n) number of commits,
(e) edition,
(t) number of merged tickets,
(p) merged tickets average lead time,
(r) average time to review.
The computation is: velocity = n * e * t / (1000 * p * r).

Augmenting the teams' velocity should be your goal as a manager.
To do so, you have to identify the pain points in your organization such as stale tickets and lack of reviews.

In the future we will offer tooling and learning to augment your velocity.

## Feature

In agile development, a feature is a chunk of functionality that delivers business value. Features can include additions or changes to existing functionality. For planning purposes, some agile methodologies also use the notion of "work items" that can include features, bug fixes, documents, and other artifacts. But features are the main unit of planning. Ideally, a feature should adhere to the following criteria:

It should provide business value
It should be estimable - it must have enough definition for the development team to provide an estimate of the work involved in implementing it
It should be small enough to fit within an iteration - therefore, if it is too big, it should be broken down further
It should be testable - you should understand what automated or manual test a feature should pass in order to be acceptable to the customer

## LOCs

Using Lines Of Code (LOCs) as a metric is meaningful on large scales only. So using it project-wise makes sense. Comparing LOCs produced per developer is pointless since their work may differ qualitatively. But comparing the evolution of LOCs sprints-wise gives a macrocopic view of your progress.

Remember to exclude large autogenerated files from the analysis by setting the exclusion patterns in our app.

## Commit

Commit to fulfill the Sprint Goal, which if well-crafted, tells the Development Team members why they are building the Increment. Unlike the list of selected Product Backlog Items for the Sprint, the Sprint Goal is coarse enough to allow the Development Team to navigate and satisfy the commitment. This avoids anyone blindly expecting that any single selected item will be delivered under any circumstance.
Commit to assure that they deliver a usable increment at the end of the Sprint, which includes only items that are fully finished according to the Definition of Done that has been agreed to beforehand.
Commit to continuously inspect and adapt, to better support the empiricism that lies at the heart of Scrum.
And at the end, commit to the values and elements that build up the framework, which allow us to tell that we are doing Scrum instead of anything else.
